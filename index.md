# About Me

<br>

Here is **Shen Shelly Yue (沈悦)**. I am pursuing my master's degree in <font color='DarkViolet'>Accounting</font> at <font color='DarkViolet'>The University of Hong Kong</font>. **I am currently seeking <font color='DarkViolet'>PhD opportunities</font> beginning in <font color='DarkViolet'>Fall 2024 or 2025</font>.** If you have any information or leads, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Many thanks! :) 

<br>

During my undergraduate studies at the <font color='DarkViolet'>University of Macau</font>, I was introduced to Ball and Brown's 1968 study in Accounting Theory course, which piqued my interest in accounting research. 

As a research assistant at UM, I delved into the <font color='DarkViolet'>biodiversity section of CSR</font>, further expanding my understanding of accounting research and leading me to consider naturalistic insights. At PKU, I collaborated on a project <font color='DarkViolet'>investigating the potential role of urbanization in carbon emissions in China</font> by employing the Spatial Durbin model. 

My research interests mainly focus on <font color='DarkViolet'>CSR and ESG</font>. Previously, as a research assistant, I skimmed over 1,000 ESG reports from Hong Kong-listed companies and noticed that many lacked substantive content. This led me to ponder whether our ESG disclosures genuinely aid in sustainable development for our society, humanity, and the planet. Therefore, I developed a strong interest in researching CSR and ESG, while <font color='DarkViolet'>I am willing to explore other accounting issues</font>. Specifically, I intend to research on:

- Analyzing greenwashing issues, including the factors influencing greenwashing and the ability of investors to recognize greenwashing.
- Studying the market effectiveness of ESG disclosures, i.e., whether investors react to these disclosures.
- Exploring the transformation of ESG's 'pre-financial information' into valuation and analyzing the potential impact of ESG factors on company fundamentals.

<br>

I'd be delighted to connect if you're interested in collaborating or discussing any aspect of my work. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at - ***yueshen@connect.hku.hk***
