# About Me

<img src="https://shenyue0324.github.io/images/yueshen.um.graduate.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shen Shelly Yue (沈悦)**. I am taking my master's degree majoring in **Accounting** at **The University of Hong Kong**. 


During my undergraduate studies at the **University of Macau**, I was introduced to Ball and Brown's 1968 study in Accounting Theory course, which piqued my interest in accounting research. As a research assistant at UM, I delved into the **biodiversity section of CSR**, further expanding my understanding of accounting research and leading me to consider naturalistic insights. At PKU, I collaborated on a project investigating the potential role of urbanization in carbon emissions in China by employing the spatial Durbin model. 


Confronted with the challenges of unstructured data, I pursued my master’s degree in accounting at the University of Hong Kong to obtain training in **data analytics, text analysis, and natural language processing in finance**. I used Python (1) to **perform web scraping and extract investors’ sentiments** and (2) to crawl the biodiversity section of the ESG reports of over 500 Hong Kong-listed companies, coding their biodiversity performance.


I'd be delighted to connect if you're interested in collaborating or discussing any aspect of my work. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at - *yueshen@connect.hku.hk*
