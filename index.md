# About Me

<img src="https://shenyue0324.github.io/images/yueshen.um.graduate.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Shen Shelly Yue (沈悦)**. I am pursuing my master's degree in <font color='DarkViolet'>Accounting</font> at <font color='DarkViolet'>The University of Hong Kong</font>. I am currently seeking <font color='DarkViolet'>PhD opportunities</font> beginning in <font color='DarkViolet'>Fall 2024 or 2025</font>. If you have any information or leads, please don't hesitate to get in touch. Many thanks! :) 

<br>

During my undergraduate studies at the <font color='DarkViolet'>University of Macau</font>, I was introduced to Ball and Brown's 1968 study in Accounting Theory course, which piqued my interest in accounting research. 

<br>

As a research assistant at UM, I delved into the <font color='DarkViolet'>biodiversity section of CSR</font>, further expanding my understanding of accounting research and leading me to consider naturalistic insights. At PKU, I collaborated on a project <font color='DarkViolet'>investigating the potential role of urbanization in carbon emissions in China</font> by employing the Spatial Durbin model. 

<br>

I pursued my master’s degree in accounting at the University of Hong Kong to obtain training in <font color='DarkViolet'>data analytics, text analysis, and NLP</font>. I used Python (1) to perform web scraping and extract investors’ sentiments and (2) to crawl the biodiversity section of the ESG reports of over 500 Hong Kong-listed companies, coding their biodiversity performance.

<br>


I'd be delighted to connect if you're interested in collaborating or discussing any aspect of my work. Please feel free to reach out to me via email at - *yueshen@connect.hku.hk*
