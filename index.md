Here is **Shen Shelly Yue (沈悦)**. I am pursuing my doctoral degree in <font color='DarkViolet'>Accounting</font> at <font color='DarkViolet'>The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen</font>. 

<br>

During my undergraduate studies at the <font color='DarkViolet'>University of Macau</font>, I started to learned Ball and Brown’s 1968 study in the Accounting Theory course, which piqued my interest in accounting research.
